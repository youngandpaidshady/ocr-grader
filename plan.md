This is the school mark book
It’s divided into termly basis, first term,2nd term and 3rd term as seen in the pics
Look at those columns, 1,2,3,4,5 those columns will be added together and divided by 2, the result written to column 6, and added to column 7(EXAM) to get 8(Total)

For 2nd term and 3rd term, the previous term(s) total should be added and divided accordingly eg by 2 second term and 3 for third term, the guide is quite self explanatory 
 Column 1-5 should equal 60/2 = 30 I.e 10 per column with one being 20, the one being 20 can’t be 1st CA and 2nd CA
Exam is equal 70

Column 1 -1st CA
Column 2- 2nd CA
Column 3-5(open day, note, assignment and attendance) in no definite order, that means one column will contain two elements I.e the 20 column… in most cases open day is the 3rd column
