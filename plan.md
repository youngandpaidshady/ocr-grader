and currently smart mode doesnt have an upload option to process data, its not smart yet...should be able to accept data and ask what they wanna do on it like pics of students score, excel data, a missing student score sheet etc
Scan more paper should reset glitchy camera
Instead of zero, the non found student should be left empty
Subject is coming back as uncategorized instead of subject name
after scanning script in general, its dumpint lots of information which are actually good, they tell the teacher a feedback, but it should be nested
the only data i wanna have is the class list and student name, their score is none of the system's business, 
so, after grading and exporting, suggest a button to share scoresheet to a colleague as backup, 
Not everyone takes this — only scanned students will appear in results. Use Smart Mode if someone's name is missing.(make smart mode clickable here)
what kind of test is this? is covering the next action
i have script is opening like the attached image by default, position opening properly, remove the qsi smrt grader hero in that particular page to allow for more room to see everything, check attached pics to see how it should look, the grade paper now still missing in frame far at the bottom(what do you suggest? 
simplify the term save grades to active roster
i have an excel sheet is holding unto cache of uploaded scripts even after i click start fresh
add the back arrow button where necessary
downloaded excel should be named after subject/class
what happens when a student name is found in two classes?
if i grade for two or more classes, how does excel arrange data?
i have a score list, if i take pics or uploaded there is no way ill know an action is happening,
add student manually if clicked by mistake, there is no way to remove the input box
on opening the text box in smart assistant, the alignment is all ovr the place, had to manually drag zoom to fit again
caches that can mess with data should be wiped on start fresh
