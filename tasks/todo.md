## Current Task: 21st Dev Frontend UI Polish

### Plan
- [x] **Design Brief & System Setup:** Define the HSL color palette based on AI/Tech (Electric Violet/Indigo) in `index.html`'s `<style>`. Add CSS variables for `--background`, `--card`, `--primary`, etc.
- [x] **Typography:** Swap to premium fonts (Space Grotesk + Inter) and update text sizes/hierarchy.
- [x] **Depth & Texture Layers:** Introduce the spatial zone concept. Add Z-layers consisting of a dark background with an ambient glow (`blur-[120px]`) and a noise grain overlay.
- [x] **Component Polish:** Transform the plain white cards into glassmorphic (`glass`, `backdrop-blur`) and card layers with thin `border-white/10`.
- [x] **Interactive Elements:** Update buttons with `shadow-glow`, active `scale-95` transformations, and premium hover states.
- [x] **Animations:** Inject staggered entrance animations (raw CSS or Tailwind plugins) so sections glide in rather than appearing statically.

### Verify Plan
- Will check if the contrast ratios are readable (WCAG AA).
- Will scroll on mobile emulation to verify no overflow.
- Will verify responsiveness and visual premium aesthetic (glows, glass filters, noise).

### Lessons
- None yet.
